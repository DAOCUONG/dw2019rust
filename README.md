# Workshop: Use Rust in iOS Apps

Welcome to /dev/world 2019! In this workshop we will:

* See why you might want to use Rust on iOS in the first place
* Write a simple Rust library and use public crates
* Cross-compile our code for iOS hardware and simulators
* Set up Xcode so we can use our Rust code easily from Swift
* Learn how to write Rust and Swift that interacts via a C ABI

This repository contains the written instructions and bonus exercises. There will also be some talking and slides, which are being presented at the /dev/world conference in Melbourne on 2 September 2019.
